Some time around September 14th 2020,

got muted in the Powercord server, later at 01:47:36 UTC+1, he pushed obfuscated
malicious code to all of his plugins with the goal of grabbing Powercord staff’s
tokens. He did succeed, and got a staff member (Ben (465668689920917534))'s
token, and managed to delete all of Powercord’s channels and roles under staff
and privated all his plugin's repositories. Even later, wave 2, his plugins went
public, but this time, with the intention of grabbing everyone's tokens.
