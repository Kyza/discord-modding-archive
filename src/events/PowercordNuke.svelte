<h1>The Powercord Nuke</h1>

<p>
	Some time around September 14th 2020,
	<User id="426147523305144322" />
	<User id="220584715265114113" />
	got muted in the Powercord server, later at 01:47:36 UTC+1, he pushed
	obfuscated malicious code to all of his plugins with the goal of grabbing
	Powercord staff’s tokens. He did succeed, and got a staff member (Ben
	(465668689920917534))'s token, and managed to delete all of Powercord’s
	channels and roles under staff and privated all his plugin's repositories.
	Even later, wave 2, his plugins went public, but this time, with the
	intention of grabbing everyone's tokens.
