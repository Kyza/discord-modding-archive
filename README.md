# All the discord modding drama
I listed every kinda of known drama about the problematic discord modding community, that sadly has a bad history. I hope that everything gets better any day<br>
Also everything here is in the chronological date, or at least i tried to put

- BetterDocs/DiscordSource
- Powercord war against its fork called Vizality where nobody asked
- Powercord new license
- Pu banning swishtilous for distribuing message loggers?????????????? (and without proofs)
- A user's mute on powercord server
- A user's mute on powercord server 2
- Hellbound attack on powercord server

## Non-chronological date events
- Pu rage banning other people with him

#### No idea when that happened
- The Saza Oopsie
- DB/NFLD Message Logger Ban Attempt
