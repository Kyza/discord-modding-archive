# All the discord modding drama.
I listed every kinda of known drama about the problematic discord modding community, that sadly has a bad history.
I hope that everything gets better any day.
Also everything here is in the chronological date, or at least I tried to put.
If you wanna add more, free feel to make a issue or a PR.

## Known Dates

- BetterDocs/DiscordSource
  - It was a famous website where BD plugins and themes are distributed. But these wasn't distributed without permission of the plugin and themes respective devs. Luckily for us it got shut down after a time.
- Powercord VS Vizality
  - A fork of Powercord was made by Baked/dperolio called Vizality. One of the Powercord devs, Bowser65, didn't liked to have the idea of a fork about his product, so he's trying his best to end this fork. But really nobody asked for a war against it.
- Powercord New License
  - Some weeks after Vizality's fork was known, Powercord devs made a new license for the project called Porkord. One theory to why this license exists is to try stop Vizality's development, since it only allows forks if the permission was gaven, and obviously they wouldn't give to Baked.
- DB/NFLD Message Logger Ban Attempt
- BD Swishilicous Ban
  - For some reason Pu thought that a known user in Discord's mod community called Swishilicous was giving message loggers to users. According to that user, he wasn't giving message loggers.
- Pu's Wrath
- The Saza Oopsie
- The Muting of A user
  - Actually me (A user) got muted 2 times on Powercord server. The first one was when I was talking about distros, and then Bowser65 criticized about my distro that I was using in that moment, Ubuntu. Then I got angry and we started to quarrel about Arch and Ubuntu, and in the end I got muted after that. I got unmuted after a time. The second I still don't know why it happened, and yes I'm still muted. If you (Bowser65) is reading this, please consider a unmute.
- The Powercord Nuke
  - *need to write more about*
